## Project

Performing some data analysis & visualization using <a href="https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-ja-espoon-kaupunkipyorilla-ajatut-matkat">open source dataset from avoindata.fi</a>.

</br>The project was carried out using the Micrsoft Power BI platform.</br>
The steps applied included reading and transforming the dataset in Power Query editor, a component of the Power BI Desktop.</br>
The reports created was completed using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/dax-overview">DAX(Data Analysis Expressions), a formula expression language used in Analysis Services, Power BI, Power Pivot and Excel</a>

After data transformation, the next stage was asking the questions
<dl>
  <dt>---Which bike origin station is popular</dt>
  <dd>---Popularity by week days and weekends</dd>
  <dd>---Popularity by leaving hour of the day</dd>
  <dd>---Popularity by maximum distance travelled</dd>
  <dd>---Most popular date during by trip taken</dd>
  <dd>---Most popular destination froms starting point</dd>
  ...AND future insights questions as to what makes a location popular within the region using map visualizations.
  For example the presence of a pub, grocessry stories and some of the answers from map visualizations shows the presence
  of pub with more trips taken after midnight.
